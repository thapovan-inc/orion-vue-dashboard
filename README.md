# Vue App Base

This repo provides a starting point for Vue.JS projects. It includes all the bells and whistles,
not just for Vue itself but also Webpack for building and deploying apps based on it. You can
start new projects by copying from this repo, but it's recommended that you fork instead, so
you can bring in upstream changes/updates as they're made.

This project includes some modules that may not be required for every application, such as a
sample Firebase data display. You can ignore/omit these if you want. Firebase itself more than
doubles the size of a Vue app, so don't include it just for fun. But it was easier to include
as much as possible here and allow developers to strip down their apps from there, than to
try to provide optional/extra functionality that developers would need to enable.

This template is itself based heavily on https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack. Please
see that project for additional information on things like `npm` commands available.
